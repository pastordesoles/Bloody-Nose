## General Information

This is my final project for the ISDI Coders web development bootcamp 2022-09 BCN Edition.
It's an application that allows you to post martials arts training sessions and look for partners to help you improve in the discipline of your choice.

As a martial arts enthusiast myself, I sometimes struggle to find training partners whenever I'm not in my dojo or when I try other styles just for fun.

With this app I want to create a hub for people to help them find someone near them and never stop training.
